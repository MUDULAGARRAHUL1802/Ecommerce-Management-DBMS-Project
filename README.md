# Ecommerce-Management-DBMS-Project
In this modern era of online shopping no seller wants to be left behind, moreover due to its simplicity the shift from offline selling model to an online selling model is witnessing a rampant growth.
Therefore, as an engineer our job is to ease the path of this transition for the seller. Amongst many things that an online site requires the most important is a database system. Hence in this project we are planning to design a database where small clothing sellers can sell their product online.
